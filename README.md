Contains:

MinMax Lab test spec and program

<b>AritGeo lab</b>
Description: A function called aritGeo that takes one argument, an Array. It checks if the array passed as an argument is arithmetic, geometric, neither arithmetic nor geometric in progression or if the array is empty.

<b><i>How to run tests</i></b>
Clone this repository
Navigate to the program folder
